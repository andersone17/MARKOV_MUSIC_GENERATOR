## Phase 1 EDA
a. Create a meta data - feature names and label  
b. Analysis features - Descriptive stats, multi var. analysis, Visualization, pattern/trends  

---

## Phase 2 Data Preparation
a. Cleaning: Handle missing values(imputes), duplicates, inconsistencies,  
b. Feature engineering: Domain-specific features, interactions, aggregations  
c. Encoding: One-hot, label encoding, embeddings  
d. Scaling/normalization: Min-Max, StandardScaler, RobustScaler  
e. Features selection - Which variable to use etc. this is extremely important  
Features selection can be PCA, K-nn mean, Lasso, Multi-correlation etc.  

---

## Phase 3 Model
Split - Train/val/test. Train data set is for traing the model, val to validate and ensure no overfiting etc. Test or Out-of-Time data is the final results.  
Modeling

## Phase 4 compare results - ad hoc analysis etc.

## Phase 5 Write up
